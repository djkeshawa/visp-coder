Build a small spreadsheet engine with a line-based command interface.

Contract (follow it exactly; it will be tested by piping commands to your program):

- Start command: `./run.sh` reads commands from standard input, one per line, and writes one output line for every `GET` and for every invalid command. Use only the standard library of Python 3.10 or Node.js 22; no dependency downloads.
- Cells are named by one letter `A`–`Z` followed by a row `1`–`99` (for example `A1`, `Z99`); letters are case-insensitive on input.
- Commands (keywords are case-insensitive, separated by single spaces):
  - `SET <cell> <content>`: everything after the second space is the cell's raw content. Content starting with `=` is a formula. Content that is a number (an optional `+` or `-`, one or more digits, then optionally `.` and one or more digits, for example `-3` or `2.50`; `.5` and `1e3` are not numbers) is a number. Any other content is text. Empty content clears the cell.
  - `GET <cell>`: prints the cell's current value.
  - `CLEAR <cell>`: empties the cell.
  - Any other line, a `SET`/`GET`/`CLEAR` with a missing or invalid cell name, prints `ERROR` and changes nothing. Blank lines are ignored.
- Values printed by `GET`:
  - An empty cell prints an empty line.
  - Numbers print without a trailing `.0`: integers as integers; other numbers rounded to at most 6 decimal places with trailing zeros removed (`1/3` prints `0.333333`, `2/4` prints `0.5`). Negative zero prints `0`.
  - Text prints as stored.
  - Errors print as their code: `#DIV/0!`, `#VALUE!`, `#REF!`, `#CYCLE!`, `#PARSE!`.
- Formulas:
  - Numbers (digits with an optional `.` and digits), cell references, parentheses, binary `+ - * / ^` and unary `-` and `+`.
  - Precedence from highest: unary sign, then `^` (right-associative), then `*` and `/`, then `+` and `-` (left-associative). So `=-2^2` is `4` and `=2^3^2` is `512`.
  - Functions `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX` (case-insensitive) take one or more arguments separated by commas; each argument is an expression or a range `A1:B3` (any two corners, inclusive). They ignore empty and text cells inside ranges; a text value passed directly as an argument is `#VALUE!`. `MIN` and `MAX` over no numbers are `0`.
  - An empty cell counts as `0`. A formula that is just a reference (`=A1`) takes the referenced value, including text; text used with any operator or sign is `#VALUE!`.
  - Spaces are allowed between tokens.
- Errors:
  - Division by zero is `#DIV/0!`.
  - A reference to a cell outside `A1`–`Z99` (for example `AA1` or `A100`) is `#REF!`.
  - A formula that cannot be parsed, or uses an unknown function, is `#PARSE!`.
  - Every cell whose formula is part of a reference cycle is `#CYCLE!`. A cell that depends on an error cell takes that error; if several operands are errors, the first one in left-to-right order in the formula wins, and inside a range the first in row order (row by row, left to right within a row).
- Values always reflect the current contents of all cells: changing a cell updates every cell that depends on it, and removing a cycle removes the `#CYCLE!` results.
- Include a README with run instructions and your own automated tests.
