Use one slice unless the request has parts a user could use independently; each extra slice
adds a check-and-review cycle. Close each slice with visp done before starting the next.
A slice may declare taskClass: feature, bugfix, refactor, test, docs, chore or config.
It selects relevant admitted skills; omit it when unknown. It does not change scope or acceptance requirements.
Scope entries are repository-relative file paths/globs, not descriptions of behavior.
Prefer patch for changes: arrays merge entries by id, omitted entries are preserved, and new entries may omit id.
Do not include version, feature, originalRequest or acceptanceBaseline in a patch.
Checks must assert actual expected results. ${CHECK_OUTPUT_GUIDANCE}
