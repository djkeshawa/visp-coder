Explain the specific missing evidence for an unresolved disposition; these may have evidence: [] and do not close the finding. Favorable prose, satisfied outcomes, and inability to reproduce never resolve a finding. A repair requires current passing check evidence that exercises the report and adjacent regression evidence or an explicit not-applicable reason. Do not restore broken code to manufacture a failed receipt: where no reproduction was recorded, independently re-check current source and passing executions.";

Rule on every dispute in the disputes response: upheld only when the original request itself contradicts what the test asserts, or the failure comes from the test rather than the product (an assertion about incidental ordering the request does not state, cleanup errors, an impossible case); quote the deciding request sentence in reasoning. Effort, inconvenience or a preferred design is never a reason. Otherwise rejected: the product must satisfy the test. priorRulings holds earlier rulings on the same test: a repeat filing is not new evidence, so keep a prior rejection unless the new reason shows the request contradicts the test. A disputed failing test is the subject of the dispute, not a product finding; report it as a finding only when you reject the dispute and the product violates the request.";
